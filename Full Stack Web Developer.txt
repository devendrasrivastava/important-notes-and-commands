How to become a Full Stack Web Developer
If you want to become a full stack developer, you need to know HTML, CSS, JavaScript along with a backend but making the right choice in an era where there are a lot of options creates a lot of confusion for newbie developers.
The Bucket Technique
As a part of this technique, we will study each technology just enough to start building sites. 
My breakdown for frontend and backend development is as follows:
FrontEnd Development:
80% HTML
60% CSS
50% JavaScript
20% Database (Insert, Update, Delete)

After you finish learning all these technologies, you will be able to build good designs but it is not possible to build a stunning website without graphic designing skills. You need to either be a good designer or refer to some design which is good enough for your site to look amazing!
For that you can either refer to some websites which are already built by great designers or work on your own design before you get your hands dirty with coding!
BackEnd Development 
I recommend following options from a huge list of available options with pros and cons:
PHP - Easy to learn, best for beginners, limited support of libraries
NodeJs - JavaScript which you already know from frontend, Difficult to learn JavaScript concepts like callbacks are used
Django/Flask (Python based backend Frameworks) - Includes ORM, great set of python libraries, need to learn python

Not recommended for beginners
Frontend frameworks like react, vue, angular
Third party JavaScript, CSS frameworks
Website builders

Don't get me wrong here. JavaScript frameworks are amazing but if you want to be a successful web developer, you need to master HTML, CSS, JavaScript first
